Linux Discord rich presence for music, using MPRIS with **album cover and progress bar support**. You can customize additional buttons, such as linking to your Last.fm profile or searching for the current song on YouTube. There's also an option to display either the music player's icon or your Last.fm avatar next to the album cover. The application is written in Rust.

## Supported players

Any player or app with [MPRIS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) support. Basically nearly every music application on Linux supports MRPIS in some way so there are plenty of compatible players. Web browsers also support MPRIS so this will work even with music streaming services playing in Google Chrome or Firefox.

## Requirements

Any fairly new 64-bit Linux distribution. It will probably also work on older versions of Linux but would have to be manually compiled on an older system. The optional background service and automatic startup capabilities rely on systemd.

## Installation

### Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and derivatives (.deb)

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

Download the latest .deb file from the [Releases](https://github.com/patryk-ku/mpris-discord-rpc/releases) page.

Now double-click it from file explorer to install it using Software Manager or use this command:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i mpris-discord-rpc.deb
```

</details>

### Fedora, openSUSE and derivatives (.rpm)

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

Download the latest .rpm file from the [Releases](https://github.com/patryk-ku/mpris-discord-rpc/releases) page.

Double-click the file in your file explorer to install it using your distribution's software manager.

Alternatively, you can use the following commands:

Fedora

```sh
sudo dnf install ./mpris-discord-rpc.rpm
```

openSUSE

```sh
sudo zypper install mpris-discord-rpc.rpm
```

</details>

### Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS and derivatives (AUR)

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

Available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mpris-discord-rpc). Install with your favorite AUR helper:

```sh
yay -S mpris-discord-rpc
```

</details>

### Other Distributions

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

Download the latest executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/patryk-ku/mpris-discord-rpc/releases) page (just a `mpris-discord-rpc` file) and grant execute permissions:

```sh
chmod +x mpris-discord-rpc
```

You can now add the binary to your PATH or create an alias.  However, for the systemd service to function correctly after running `mpris-discord-rpc enable`, the file must be located at `/usr/bin/mpris-discord-rpc`.  Alternatively, you can modify the `ExecStart` path in the `~/.config/systemd/user/mpris-discord-rpc.service` file and restart the service with `mpris-discord-rpc restart`.

Alternatively, you can skip systemd and configure the binary to run on startup yourself, depending on your specific distribution and desktop environment.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> If there is no package for your distribution and you have experience creating packages for it, you can open an Issue so we can work together to add it.

## Configuration and usage

Use this command to start the service in the background and enable autostart. See the [Autostart](#autostart) section for more information.

```sh
mpris-discord-rpc enable
```

Or just directly run it in the terminal:

```sh
mpris-discord-rpc
```

You can change the default settings using arguments or by editing config file. Launch executable with `-h` or `--help` for aditional info:

```
mpris-discord-rpc --help

### Autostart

The `enable` subcommand automatically reloads the systemd daemon and enables the service, `disable` will disable the service, and `restart` will restart it.

You can check the service status with:

```sh
systemctl --user status mpris-discord-rpc.service
```

And check the logs with:

```sh
journalctl --user -u mpris-discord-rpc.service
```

Or monitor the logs in real-time with:

```sh
journalctl --user -u mpris-discord-rpc.service -f
```

### Config

The application will generate a configuration file at `~/.config/mpris-discord-rpc/config.yaml` when you run it for the first time. You can reset or regenerate it with `--reset-config`. You can also check default config file here: [config.yaml](config.yaml).

After editing the file, run the `mpris-discord-rpc restart` command to reload the systemd service and apply the changes.

### Allowlist

To select the music players, use the `-a`,`--allowlist-add` argument or `allowlist` in the config file. This argument can be used multiple times to add more players. The order matters and the first is the most important.

arguments:

```sh
mpris-discord-rpc -a "VLC Media Player" -a "Chrome" -a "Any other player"
```

config:

```yaml
allowlist:
  - "VLC Media Player"
  - "Chrome"
  - "Any other player"
```

Use the `-l`, `--list-players` to get your player name.

### "Watching Video" activity

You can mark players as video players using the `-w`,`--video-players` argument or `video_players` in the config file. Then the status will be "Watching Video" and the RPC will be more suitable for videos. This argument can be used multiple times to add more players.

arguments:

```sh
mpris-discord-rpc -w "VLC Media Player" -w "Chrome" -w "Any other player"
```

config:

```yaml
video_players:
  - "VLC Media Player"
  - "Chrome"
  - "Any other player"
```

It's also possible to display a thumbnail or cover of the video you're watching (e.g., from YouTube), but this requires a player that provides the URL via MPRIS. There aren't many players that do this natively, but `mpv` with the `mpv-mpris` plugin will share the thumbnail of a video piped to it from `yt-dlp`. Other custom YouTube players sometimes have similar functionality. Streaming apps like Jellyfin should work too. Additionally, Chromium-based browsers or Firefox (and forks) can achieve similar functionality using a browser extension.

KDE Plasma:

- Google Chrome, Chromium, and Vivaldi: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/plasma-integration/cimiefiiaegbelhefglklhhakcgmhkai
- Mozilla Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/plasma-integration/
- Microsoft Edge: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/plasma-integration/dnnckbejblnejeabhcmhklcaljjpdjeh

GNOME (not tested):

- Google Chrome, Chromium, and Vivaldi: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/integracja-z-gnome-shell/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep
- Mozilla Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/

> [!CAUTION]
> Using this RPC with browser extensions can potentially compromise your privacy. Most videos played in the browser will be displayed as your activity, including content from sites like Instagram, FB, Twitter, etc. Even NSFW content might be displayed with thumbnails, which could result in a ban from Discord or removal from servers. You can disable thumbnail display using the `--disable-mpris-art-url` argument or by setting `disable_mpris_art_url` to true in the config file.

### Buttons

You can choose from available options (max 2):

- `yt` - Search this song on YouTube.
- `lasfm` - Last.fm profile.
- `listenbrainz` - Listenbrainz profile.
- `mprisUrl` - Some custom YT players, Jellyfin, mpv or browsers with extension may provide a URL to the currently playing content (see the "Watching Video" activity section for more details). When available, a "Play Now" button will be displayed for music and a "Watch Now" button for video. If the URL is not available, this button will be replaced with a `yt` button.
- `shamelessAd` - Link to the repository of this RPC.

Remember to provide your usernames for the services you want to add as buttons.

arguments:

```sh
mpris-discord-rpc -b yt -b lastfm --lastfm-name nickname
```

config:

```yaml
allowlist:
  - "yt"
  - "lastfm"

lastfm_name: "nickname"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After Discord recent profile layout update, users cannot see their activity buttons anymore, BUT other users can see them. This is not a bug but a feature from Discord. You can make sure the buttons work by logging into an alternative account in your browser, or just by asking a friend :)

> You can request more buttons by opening an Issue.

### The icon next to the album cover

You can choose from available options: `playPause`, `player`, `lastfmAvatar`, `none`.

arguments:

```sh
mpris-discord-rpc -s player
```

config:

```yaml
small_image: player
```

Available music player icons: `Amberol`, `Audacious`, `Elisa`, `Firefox`, `GNOME Music`, `Google Chrome`, `Lollypop`, `Mozilla Firefox`, `mpv`, `Spotify`, `Strawberry`, `Tauon`, `TIDAL Hi-Fi`, `VLC Media Player`, `YouTube`, `Zen Browser`.

You can also force a different player icon and name to be displayed than the one actually used.

arguments:

```sh
mpris-discord-rpc --force-player-id "vlc_media_player" --force-player-name "VLC media player"
```

config:

```yaml
force_player_id: "vlc_media_player"
force_player_name: "VLC media player"
```

Icons are available for these ids: `amberol`, `audacious`, `chrome`, `elisa`, `firefox`, `lollypop`, `mozilla_firefox`, `mozilla_zen`, `mpv`, `music`, `spotify`, `strawberry`, `tauon`, `tidalhifi`, `vlc_media_player`, `youtube`.

**Missing your player icon?** Open an Issue with:

- Icon link (png, min. 512x512 resolution - Discord requirement)
- Player ID (obtainable by running with `--debug-log` parameter, search for the line with `[debug] player_id:`)

Icons are managed through Discord Developer Portal, so no app update is needed after adding new ones.

### Flatpak Discord fix

As flatpak applications are sandboxed this makes it difficult for any other programs to communicate with them. But this can be easily fixed using the following command:

```sh
ln -sf {app/com.discordapp.Discord,$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/discord-ipc-0
```

**Unfortunately but it will need to be used every reboot**. So I would also recommend adding this command to the autostart.

## System usage

As it is a very simple program its impact on computer performance is unnoticeable. Normaly it uses around **12 MiB** of RAM but even less than **6 MiB** when fetching album covers only from cache.

If not disabled, the program stores the cache in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mpris-discord-rpc/` or `$HOME/.cache/mpris-discord-rpc/`. The application caches only image URLs from last.fm, not the images themselves, keeping the cache size small.

## Compile from source

1. Install Rust and Cargo using instructions from [Rust site](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone 'https://github.com/patryk-ku/mpris-discord-rpc'
   cd mpris-discord-rpc
   ```
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and insert here your last.fm API key. You can easily get it [here](https://www.last.fm/pl/api).
   ```sh
   mv .env.example .env
   echo LASTFM_API_KEY=insert-key-here > .env
   ```
4. Compile executable using Cargo
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```
5. The compiled executable file location is `target/release/mpris-discord-rpc`.

## Credits

I wouldn't have been able to create this without two fantastic crates: [mpris-rs](https://github.com/Mange/mpris-rs) and [discord-rich-presence](https://github.com/vionya/discord-rich-presence). Implementing these features myself would have been beyond my current skills. A huge thank you to their creators.
